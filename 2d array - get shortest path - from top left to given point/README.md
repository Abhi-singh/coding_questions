A robot can move on a rectangular grid of M rows and N columns. The robot is initially positioned at top-left cell. The robot has to reach the (X, Y) grid cell. In a single step, robot can move to top, left, right or bottom.

There some obstacles in random positions on the grid, through which the robot cannot pass. Given the positions of the blocked cells, your task is to count the number of paths that the robot can take to move from (1, 1) to (X, Y).
